- **Performance**: Optimized with efficient caching and vectorized operations

## Architecture Summary

### Data Flow:
1. **Ingestion**: IB TWS API â†’ Data Validation â†’ Parquet Storage
2. **Analytics**: Historical Data â†’ Calculations â†’ Cache Results
3. **Interface**: Cached Analytics â†’ Streamlit UI â†’ User

### Storage Architecture:
- **SQLite**: Metadata, download history, user preferences
- **Parquet**: Time series data, option chains, calculated results
- **Cache**: Pre-computed analytics in `data/cache/{symbol}/`

### Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, asyncio, pandas, numpy
- **Data**: SQLite, Parquet (pyarrow), loguru
- **API**: ib_insync for Interactive Brokers integration
- **Future**: Streamlit for web interface

## Known Issues & Considerations

### Current Limitations:
- Limited to sample symbols (AAPL, SPY, TSLA) 
- No real-time data (historical analysis only)
- User interface not yet implemented

### Phase 3 Status: **SKIPPED**
Strategy Builder & P&L Engine functionality was implemented as part of Phase 2 analytics engine.

### âœ… Phase 4 Complete: User Interface & Visualization
**Duration**: [Completed - Full Implementation]
**Status**: Production-ready Streamlit web application

#### Completed Features:
- [x] **Streamlit Web Application**: Complete multi-page interface with navigation
- [x] **Dashboard Page**: Overview with metrics, price charts, and quick actions
- [x] **Option Chain Page**: Interactive option chain display with Greeks and filtering
- [x] **Strategy Builder**: Visual strategy construction with real-time P&L analysis
- [x] **Analytics Page**: Advanced volatility analysis and performance metrics
- [x] **Data Service Layer**: Clean interface between UI and backend analytics
- [x] **Interactive Visualizations**: Plotly charts for P&L, Greeks, and volatility
- [x] **Export Functionality**: CSV download capabilities
- [x] **Responsive Design**: Professional styling and layout

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Framework**: Streamlit with multi-page architecture
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs
- **Data Integration**: Seamless connection to analytics engine
- **Caching**: Efficient data caching for performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Launch Script**: Simple `python run_ui.py` to start application

## Development Notes
