- [ ] Update deprecated SQLAlchemy warnings

## Success Criteria ✅ ALL ACHIEVED
- [x] Complete Streamlit application with all major features
- [x] Intuitive navigation between different analysis views
- [x] Interactive charts respond smoothly to user input
- [x] Complex strategies can be built through UI
- [x] All analytics accessible through web interface
- [x] Export functionality working for analysis results
- [x] Application loads and performs well with realistic data

## Technical Dependencies ✅ ALL COMPLETED
- [x] Streamlit framework (implemented and tested)
- [x] Plotly for interactive charts (fully integrated)
- [x] All UI components implemented and functional
- [x] Launch script and configuration completed

## Architecture Notes
- UI should be read-only initially (no data modification)
- Leverage existing analytics engine without modification
- Use caching extensively for performance
- Consider mobile-responsive design
- Plan for future real-time features
